This code fetches historical stock price data using the yfinance library and predicts future trends using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. It trains the model on past data, predicts the next 30 days, and visualizes the actual and predicted prices, highlighting whether the stock is expected to rise or fall.
